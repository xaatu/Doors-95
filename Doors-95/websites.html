            <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/BlueSea" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
            <p>I designed this site to a <b>specification</b> for film and video company <b>"Blue Sea Pictures"</b>.
                It features more <b>JavaScript</b> functionality than my other sites, for example <b>carousel</b> image animation
                and page fade in <b>animations.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This was the first time I had the opportunity to design to a real brief, and it gave me a
                great incentive to learn some new skills, the page fade in animations turned out great (in my opinion!)

            <h2>Blue Sea Pictures (Mobile)</h2>
            <p>The mobile version of the site gave me an opportunity to use a <b>Hamburger menu</b> and practice my use of 
                <b>media querys.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall i'm extremely happy with how the mobile site looks and feels.

            <a href="https://xaatu.com" target="_blank" id="github">Live site</a>
            <p>I designed this site based on a Wix site I had previously made. 
                I decided that I would be better off trying to build it myself from scratch, 
                to give me more experience and to save money. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Working on this site taught me a lot about <b>API's</b>, 
                and originally made use of both <b>Spotify</b> and <b>PayPal's</b>.
                I removed the PayPal functionality, and instead opted to give away
                music for free, which led to me discovering more about making <b>downloads</b> available
                to site users.
                I intend to re-enable the <b>Spotify API</b> in the future to improve <b>user experience</b>.

            <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/caitlinoreillytattoo" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
            <p>I designed this site for my girlfriends Tattoo business.
                She already had a consent form and booking form I made, which are <b>linked to her E-mail</b>,
                so we both agreed it would be better to just link to those <b>forms</b> rather than
                 making new pages.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 I wanted to incorporate her <b>live Instagram</b> feed, as <b>Instagram</b> is where she gets the majority of her customers,
                 we decided it would be good to link it so users could see her work and interact with her more easily.

            <h2>Pokemon API</h2>
            <p>This site was just an extension of a lecture on <b>APIs</b>, I decided to make it look more like the <b>Pokemon</b> theme.
                It features <b>Pokemon</b> from the first two generations, by scraping information about them, such as <b>Name</b>, <b>Type</b>, <b>Height</b>, <b>Weight</b>, <b>Abilities</b> and <b>Stats</b>.
                It also features an <b>audio element</b> to display their cry, and a <b>toggleable "Shiny" button</b>, to show their shiny variant.

            <p>
                This site was designed for a friend's timber business. 
                <br>
                <br>
                He just wanted a <b>simple design</b>, featuring the company colours and a range of products and prices.
                <br>
                <br>
                This site was my first time really getting to grips with <b>styling</b> a page, and while it is simple, I think it does the job.

            <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/arden-b-m" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
            <p>This site was for a university project on <b>web authoring</b>, we were given a <b>specification</b> but not a subject, so I chose health & fitness.
                <br>
                <br>
                The website is basic, but has a couple of <b>features</b> which I hadn't come across up to that point in my web development journey, <b>forms</b> and <b>scripts</b>.

            <h2>Top Logs</h2>
            <p>This was the first site I ever published. It was for someone I know, and he said he just wanted a simple site with the products and his phone number on it.
                <br>
                <br>
                While i'm not happy with the site overall, it did give me experience in logo design and website hosting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately when it came to website assets, such as images, I was given blurry pictures taken from a phone camera, so getting the site to look professional was difficult,
                but ultimately he was happy with it.
