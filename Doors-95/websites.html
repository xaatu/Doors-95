            <h2>Blue Sea Pictures</h2>
            <p>I designed this site to a specification for film and video company "Blue Sea Pictures".
                It features more JavaScript functionality than my other sites, for example carousel image animation
                and page fade in animations.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This was the first time I had the opportunity to design to a real brief, and it gave me a
                great incentive to learn some new skills, the page fade in animations turned out great (in my opinion!)

            <h2>Blue Sea Pictures Mobile</h2>
            <p>The mobile version of the site gave me an opportunity to use a "Hamburger" menu and practice my use of 
                media querys.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall i'm extremely happy with how the mobile site looks.

            <h2>Xaatu</h2>
            <p>I designed this site based on a Wix site I had previously made. 
                I decided that I would be better off trying to build it myself from scratch, 
                to give me more experience and to save money. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Working on this site taught me a lot about API's, 
                and originally made use of both Spotify and PayPal's.
                I removed the PayPal functionality, and instead opted to give away
                music for free, which led to me discovering more about making downloads available
                to site users.
                I intend to re-enable the Spotify API in the future to improve user experience.

            <h2>Caitlin O'Reilly Tattoo</h2>
            <p>I designed this site for my girlfriends Tattoo business.
                She already had a consent form and booking form, which are linked to her E-mail,
                so we both agreed it would be better to just link to those forms rather than
                 making new pages.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Again I wanted to incorporate an API, and as Instagram is where she gets the majority of her customers,
                 we decided it would be good to link her Instagram so users could see her work and interact with her more easily.

            <h2>Pokemon API</h2>
            <p>This site was just an extension of a lecture on APIs, I decided to make it look more like the Pokemon theme.
                It features Pokemon from the first two generations, giving some information about them, such as Name, Type, Height, Weight, Abilities and Stats.
                It also features an audio element to display their cry, and a toggleable "Shiny" button, to show their shiny variant.
