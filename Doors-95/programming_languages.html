        <h1><u>HTML</u></h1>
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>I started learning HTML during a Web Authoring module in my University course. 
            I enjoyed the module so much that I deleted my "Wix" website and decided to recreate it from scratch.
            Though I feel like there will always be something new to learn, I am comfortable in HTML and am able to troubleshoot
            any problems myself to find a solution.
            <br>
            <br>
            The additional experience I have gained throughout the JustIT course has been invaluable, and has been more than just a refresher.
            I now feel like I could be left alone to create a website to a specification and would have no issues.
        </p>
        <h1><u>CSS</u></h1>
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>My experience with CSS also started during my Web Authoring module.
            I absolutely love the creative freedom it gives and have been challenging myself to 
            learn more by finding elements of websites that look appealing and trying to replicate them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Again, the JustIT course has given me more time and experience in CSS - specifically with making this site.
            I found a framework online that gave a near-identical Windows 98 design, but instead opted to create my own Doors 95
            and the experience has been a lot more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <h1><u>Python</u></h1>
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>Python has been the most interesting language so far in my opinion. 
            I have an interest in Physics, Maths, Music and Gaming - all of which can be experimented with using Python.
            My University course does not teach Python, but after seeing all of it's powerful capabilities, 
            I started learning online using coding websites and Youtube videos.
            I have made basic platformer games, Physics calculators, a MIDI Generator, a simple drum machine, and quite a few other things.
        </p>
        <h1><u>JavaScript</u></h1>
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is probably the language I am least familiar with, but can still appreciate it's capabilities and am able to perform more basic functions using it.
            I am trying to implement more Javascript in my website projects to expand my knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            The JustIT course took me outside my comfort zone, and forced me to learn more about JavaScript. As a result, I have implemented
            numerous JS features on this website, and others that I have been working on.
        </p>
        <h1><u>SQL</u></h1>
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>I got a chance to explore SQL during my Databases module, I think with a bit more practice of normalised forms I would feel very comfortable.
            The actual SQL code itself is quite easy to understand and modify.
            I hope to get some more practice in before my Advanced Databases module.
            <br>
            <br>
            The additional SQL practice within the JustIT course, though brief, has taught me more than I was able to learn during a full 10 week module at 
            University. I now feel comfortable with creating and querying databases.
        </p>
