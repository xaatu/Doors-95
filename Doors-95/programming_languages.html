        <img src="Images/python.png" alt="Python Logo">
            <h1><u>Python</u></h1>
            <p>In my opinion, Python has been the <b>most interesting</b> language so far. 
                I have an interest in <b>Physics</b>, <b>Maths</b>, <b>Music</b> and <b>Gaming</b> - all of which can be experimented with using Python.
                My University course does not teach Python, but after seeing all of its <b>powerful capabilities</b>, 
                I started learning online using <b>coding websites</b> and <b>Youtube</b> videos.
                I have made basic <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/ninja-peeps" target="_blank">Platformer Games</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/physicscalculator" target="_blank">Physics Calculators</a>, a MIDI Generator, a simple drum machine, and quite a few <a href="https://github.com/xaatu?tab=repositories" target="_blank">other things</a>.

        <div class="programming_languages">
            <img src="Images/dart.png" alt="Dart Logo">
                <h1><u>Dart</u></h1>
                <p>While completing the technical interview for a potential job, I was asked to create an <b>IOS app</b> in <b>Flutter</b>.
                    <b>Flutter</b> is the framework, within which <b>Dart</b> is the programming language.
                    While I may not be very experienced yet, I really enjoyed learning about <b>Dart</b>, and pushing myself to add <b>new features</b>.
                    I was also able to get the app to run on my <b>IPhone</b> in profile mode, which felt great.
                    Here is an example of my <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/ninja-peeps" target="_blank">IOS app</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
    
        <div class="programming_languages">
            <img src="Images/JavaScript.png" alt="JavaScript">
            <h1><u>JavaScript</u></h1>
            <p>JavaScript is probably the language I am least familiar with, but can still appreciate its capabilities and am able to perform more basic functions using it.
                I am trying to <b>implement more Javascript</b> in my website projects to <b>expand my knowledge</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The <b>JustIT</b> course took me outside my comfort zone, and forced me to learn more about JavaScript. As a result, I have implemented
                numerous JS features on this website, and others that I have been working on. For example within in this site - <b>Night Mode</b>, <b>Clock</b>, <b>Rainbow Animated "Sandy's Desktop"</b>
                and the <b>Double Click features</b> to make the pages of the website seem more like desktop apps.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="programming_languages">
            <img src="Images/javalogo.png" alt="Java">
            <h1><u>Java</u></h1>
            <p>I used <b>Java</b> for my <b>Introduction to Programming</b> module in first year, but have not used it since. 
                At the time I was able to create a basic programme for a flower shop, where customers could choose from different sizes and different coloured bouquets.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I haven't used it again since then, I feel that I would need a bit of time to reacquaint myself with the <b>syntax</b>, but my general understanding of <b>computational logic</b> has improved since then.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="programming_languages">
        <img src="Images/html.png" alt="HTML">
        <h1><u>HTML</u></h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I started learning HTML during a <b>Web Authoring module</b> in my University course. 
            I enjoyed the module so much that I deleted my "Wix" website and decided to recreate it <b>from scratch</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Though I feel like there will always be something new to learn, I am comfortable in HTML and am able to <b>troubleshoot</b>
            any problems myself to find a <b>solution</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The additional experience I have gained throughout the JustIT course has been invaluable, and has been more than just a refresher.
            I now feel like I could be left alone to create a website to a specification and would have no issues.
        </p>
        </div>

    <div class="programming_languages">
        <img src="Images/css3.png" alt="CSS">
        <h1><u>CSS</u></h1>
        <p>My experience with CSS also started during my Web Authoring module.
            I absolutely love the <b>creative freedom</b> it gives and have been <b>challenging</b> myself to 
            learn more by finding elements of websites that look appealing and trying to <b>replicate</b> them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Again, the JustIT course has given me more time and experience in CSS - specifically with making this site.
            I found a <b>framework</b> online that gave a near-identical Windows 98 design, but instead opted to create my own Doors 95
            and the experience has been a lot more enjoyable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="programming_languages">
        <img src="Images/Sql.png" alt="SQL">
        <h1><u>SQL</u></h1>
        <p>I got a chance to explore SQL during my Databases module, I think with a bit more practice of normalised forms I would feel very comfortable.
            The actual SQL code itself is quite easy to understand and modify.
            I hope to get some more practice in before my Advanced Databases module.
            <br>
            <br>
            The additional SQL practice within the JustIT course, though brief, has taught me more than I was able to learn during a full 10 week module at 
            University. I now feel comfortable creating <b>entity relationship diagrams</b>, and with <b>creating</b> and <b>querying</b> databases.
        </p>
