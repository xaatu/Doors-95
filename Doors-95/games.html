            <h3>I have dipped my feet into game design within Python, firstly just using scripts and running them in Terminal, and then using the PyGame library - following guides and trying to customise levels and assets.

            <h4><u>Number Guessing Game</u></h4>
            <p>Below is a number guessing game, running in Terminal. It starts by defining a random_number, I set this to random.randint(1, 100), but it could be any number.</p>
            <p>The user then inputs a number, and the script prints higher, or lower - depending on the relation of user_number and random_number.</p>
            <p>I would really like to try a Wordle-like game using the same principles, but would have to import a dictionary library, or link a text file with suitable-length words.</p>

            <h4><u>Missy Munch</u></h4>
            <p>Below is a video of my game, "Missy Munch". Named after one of my cats, I made this game following a PyGame guide on YouTube, designed to help viewers build a game in the style of "Copter".</p>
            <p>Using the steps from the video, I created the basic landscape and then customised elements, which led to me designing the pixel art and music, then spending a long time learning how to animate images and import music within VS Code.</p>

            <h4><u>Ninja Peeps</u></h4>
            <p>Finally, here is a video of the hardest game I have worked on to date, Ninja Peeps. Named after my other cat, this game really stretched my knowledge (and patience...)</p>
            <p>Building on what I learned from Missy Munch, I wanted to make a platformer that features my other cat "Peeps". This was a lot harder and most of the information I was looking for was not in the YouTube videos I was watching as guides, which led to me downloading a few other platformer games on Github and testing some of their features.</p>
            <p>The plan was to start with my basic knowledge (and YouTube) on level 1, and then improve the game every level - however the problem with this, as I learned by level 3, was that by storing all of the levels within one file, it becomes a nightmare to find your way around. Also rules that you made for the first level will impact future levels unless properly defined every time, in future if I tried this again I would separate levels into different files, so any functions could be more specified.</p>
            <p>Unlike Missy Munch, which has no pre-determined end, this game crashes after level 3, as I set it to go to level_four, but never actually defined it.</p>
