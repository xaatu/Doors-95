                <p>Displayed to the left is a number guessing game script running in Terminal. It starts by defining a random_number, I set this to random.randint(1, 100), but it could be any number.

                    <br>
                    The user then inputs a number, and the script prints higher, or lower - depending on the relation of user_number and random_number.

                <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/missy-munch" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
                <p>This video is of my game, "Missy Munch", named after one of my cats.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I made this game following a <b>PyGame</b> guide on <b>YouTube</b>, designed to help viewers build a game in the style of <b>"Copter"</b> or <b>"Flappy Bird"</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
            Using the steps from the video, I created the basic landscape and then customised elements, which led to me designing the <b>pixel art</b> and <b>music</b>, then spending a long time learning how to <b>animate</b> images and <b>import</b> music within VS Code.</p>

                <h2>Ninja Peeps</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/ninja-peeps" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
                <p>Here is a video of my game, Ninja Peeps. Named after my other cat, this game really stretched my knowledge (and patience...)
                    <br>
                    <br>
            Building on what I learned from Missy Munch, I wanted to make a <b>platformer</b> that features my other cat "Peeps". This was a lot harder and most of the information I was looking for was not in the <b>YouTube</b> videos I was watching as <b>guides</b>, which led to me downloading a few other platformer games on <b>Github</b> and <b>testing</b> some of their <b>features</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The plan was to start with my basic knowledge (and YouTube) on level 1, and then improve the game every level - however the problem with this, as I learned by level 3, was that by storing all of the levels within one file, it becomes difficult to find your way around. Also rules that you made for the first level will impact future levels unless properly defined every time, in future if I tried this again I would separate levels into different files, so any <b>functions</b> could be more specified.
            <br>
                    <br>
            Unlike Missy Munch, which has no pre-determined end, this game crashes after level 3, as I set it to go to level_four, but never actually defined it.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/xaatu/rpg_snakes_on_a_plain" target="_blank" id="github">GitHub</a>
                <p>Finally, this is my newest game "Snakes on a Plain", the video shows a playthrough at 2x speed.

                    <br>
            Building on an RPG tutorial from Shawcode that featured one level, my aim was to create more levels and features, then customise the characters.
            <br>
            <br>
            While the tutorial was extremely helpful, it had certain limitations. For example, the single tilemap meant you could have blocks or grass on the ground, and a default grass floor. However, this meant that when I wanted to add a dirt path, I was unable to place a tree on it, or items such as the axe, as it would default to the grassy tile.
            <br>
            <br>
            I added in items, inventory, a specific class for non-inventory items (such as trees), more levels, itemmap as well as tilemap, so items/player/trees etc could be stacked on top of any floor surface - by extension also making new level creation much simpler,
            a score keeping graphic, new pixel art for character/enemies/axe/tree/dirt and pop-up text when enemies are killed, or the game is giving instructions.
